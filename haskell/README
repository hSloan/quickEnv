Quick start haskell environments: 

So you dont have to worry about dealing with cabal or stack
for the moment. You can use the `$nix-shell` commmand to bring
haskell packages you request, by altering  the provided `shell.nix`
file. 

Afterwards feel free to utilize the usual ghc (compiler) or 
ghci (interactive compiler commands)
