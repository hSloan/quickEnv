Getting a quick environment container with Java:

Assuming you have already set up nix package management on your machine. 
You can copy the `default.nix` file found here into your new python project 
directory as a quick start. 

Add whatever packages you would like to be in scope of your project to 
`default.nix` and simply run

```
$ nix-shell
```
